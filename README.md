# collegefinder

## By Carly Darcher [portfolio](http://carlydarcher.com/) [email](casdarcher@gmail.com)

> This site was built using the College Scorecard API, Vue.Js, and webpack. 

AN IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to work with the College Scorecard API, you will need an API key. Access to an API key can be found here (https://api.data.gov/signup/). Additionally, the most recent enrollment data is from 2015. 

This site utilizes Bootstrap, vue-analytics, and axios via npm install. The graduation and seach icons are from fontawesome. The loading animation is pure CSS and comes from [loadi.io](https://loading.io/css/). 

This site was a final project for Seattle University's Web Dev Certificate (2018). 




## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
